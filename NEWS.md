# teal.modules.hermes 0.1.0
* First release of the `teal.modules.hermes` package, which contains teal modules for RNA-seq analysis using the `hermes` package.
* New users should first begin by reading the `README.md`of the `teal.modules.hermes` package to become familiar. 

### New Features
* `tm_g_barplot` is a barplot module for RNA-seq gene expression analysis.
* `tm_g_boxplot` is a boxplot module for RNA-seq gene expression analysis.
* `tm_g_forest_tte` is a survival forest plot module for RNA-seq gene expression analysis.
* `tm_g_km` is a Kaplan-Meier plot module for data with ADaM structure.
* `tm_g_pca` is a PCA plot module including an interactive heatmap with correlation of principal components with sample variables.
* `tm_g_quality` is a module that adds quality flags, filters by genes and/or samples, normalizes `AnyHermesData` objects and provides interactive plots for RNA-seq gene expression quality control.
* `tm_g_scatterplot` is a scatterplot module for RNA-seq gene expression analysis.
* `tm_g_volcanoplot` is a volcano plot module for RNA-seq gene expression analysis.
